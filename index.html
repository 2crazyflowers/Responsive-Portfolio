				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<img src="assets/images/Sara-Bracewell-11-Web.jpg" alt="Image of sara">
				<p>	I am learning web development in a fullstack bootcamp through the University of Minnesota. I enjoy coding and debugging websites. I love it when I get websites to look right and work perfectly!</p>
				<p>	Previously I worked as a landscape designer and project manager for 5 years then went to bookkeeping and office management for 10 years. I got interested in web development during my previous job and found that it was fun and I wanted to learn more! Once my classes are complete I am looking forward to a career change into web development.</p>
				<p>	I am married to a great guy, have 2 children (who  keep me on my toes and astonish me daily) as well as 2 cats, 1 dog and 3 aquariums (and yes, we have a very full house!). I love spending time with my family and friends, traveling, hiking, kayaking and fixing up houses.</p>
